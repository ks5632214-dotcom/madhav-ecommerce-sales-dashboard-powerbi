# 🛍️ Madhav Ecommerce Sales Dashboard | Power BI

## **1️. Project Overview**

This dashboard transforms raw ecommerce transactional data into actionable business insights to support strategic decision-making.

Ecommerce businesses generate large volumes of transactional data. However, without structured analysis, it is difficult to identify:

- High-performing states.

Raw data alone does not provide clear decision-making insights.
